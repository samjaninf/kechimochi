# Release Process

This document defines how Kechimochi ships application releases and development artifacts.

## Versioning Model

Kechimochi now uses three independent version concepts:

- App version: semantic versioning (`X.Y.Z`) for user-facing releases.
- Database schema version: an integer stored in SQLite and managed separately from app releases.
- Backup format version: an integer for full-backup packaging and manifest compatibility.

These three versions move for different reasons:

- app version changes when the product ships a new release,
- database schema version changes when persisted data shape or meaning changes,
- backup format version changes when the zip layout or manifest contract changes.

For the database and backup compatibility policy, see `docs/database-versioning.md`.

## Release Tracks

### Release Track

Release builds are created only from Git tags that match `vX.Y.Z`.

- The checked-in version files must already be set to the release version.
- The release workflow publishes assets to the GitHub Releases tab.
- While the app is in beta, release builds display `BETA VERSION X.Y.Z` in the UI.
- GitHub Releases are marked as prereleases until beta is over.

### Development Track

Development builds continue to come from regular pushes to `main`.

- They are published as workflow artifacts, not GitHub Releases.
- The displayed version is derived from the checked-in base version plus the current commit hash.
- Example: if `package.json` is `0.1.0`, a development build from `main` shows `DEV BUILD 0.1.0-dev.abc1234`.

## Source of Truth

The app version is stored in these files and must always match:

- `package.json`
- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

Use the helper script to update them together:

```bash
npm run version:set -- 0.1.0
```

## Changelog Workflow

`CHANGELOG.md` at the repository root is the canonical release notes file.

Rules:

- Add ongoing release notes to `## [Unreleased]` while work is in progress.
- When preparing a release, move the finalized notes into `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`.
- The release workflow extracts that exact section and uses it as the GitHub Release body.

You can preview what the workflow will publish with:

```bash
npm run changelog:extract -- 0.1.0
```

## Releasing `0.1.0`

The release flow should happen through a release PR.

1. Create a release branch from `main`.
2. Update the version files and finalize the `CHANGELOG.md` section for `0.1.0`.
3. Open a PR, review it, and merge it into `main`.
4. After the PR is merged, tag the merge commit that now lives on `main`:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Kechimochi v0.1.0"
git push origin v0.1.0
```

5. The `release.yml` workflow publishes the tagged artifacts to GitHub Releases.

## Continuing Development After a Release

Development builds always derive from the checked-in base version on `main`.

That means:

- If `main` stays on `0.1.0`, development artifacts continue to show `0.1.0-dev.<sha>`.
- When you intentionally start the next cycle, bump `main` to the next target version first.
- If you use a PR-only workflow, do that bump in a normal follow-up PR after the release tag is published.
- Example: after releasing `0.1.0`, merge a PR that runs `npm run version:set -- 0.2.0` so future artifacts show `0.2.0-dev.<sha>`.

## Beta Stage

The release workflow currently builds with the release stage set to `beta`.

Implications:

- Release builds display `BETA VERSION X.Y.Z`.
- GitHub Releases are published as prereleases.

When Kechimochi exits beta, update the release workflow to use `stable` instead of `beta`. That will switch the UI label to `VERSION X.Y.Z` and publish normal releases.

## GitHub Workflows

- `.github/workflows/publish.yml`: development artifacts from `main`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: tagged GitHub Releases from `vX.Y.Z`
- `.github/workflows/docker.yml`: container publishing for both dev (`main`) and release (`vX.Y.Z`) builds
