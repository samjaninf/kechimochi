## What is Kechimochi?

Kechimochi is a **desktop activity tracker** designed for people studying languages through immersion. It helps you log, visualize, and analyze time spent consuming media in your target language, whether you're reading manga, watching anime, playing games, or listening to podcasts.

## Features

### Dashboard
- **Tracking Heatmap** -- A GitHub-style yearly contribution heatmap showing your daily activity. Navigate between years to see your historical immersion journey.
- **Study Stats** -- A statistics panel showing:
  - Total lifetime logs and media entries
  - Longest consecutive study streak and current active streak
  - Daily averages (total and per activity type)
  - Date of first recorded entry
- **Activity Breakdown** -- A doughnut chart showing how your time is distributed across activity types (Reading, Watching, Playing, etc.)
- **Activity Visualization** -- A bar or line chart showing your immersion over time, with configurable time ranges:
  - **Weekly** -- Day-by-day breakdown
  - **Monthly** -- Week-by-week breakdown
  - **Yearly** -- Month-by-month breakdown
- **Recent Activity** -- A timeline feed of your latest logged sessions, with the ability to delete individual entries.

### Library
- **Kanban Board** -- Organize your media into **Active** and **Finished** columns using drag-and-drop.
- **Media Management** -- Add, track, and manage individual media titles (books, shows, games, etc.)
- **Auto-status Updates** -- Logging activity for a "Finished" title automatically moves it back to "Active".

### Multi-Profile Support
- Create and switch between multiple user profiles.
- Each profile has its own independent database.
- Delete or wipe profiles as needed.

### CSV Import / Export
- **Import** -- Bring in your data from other tracking tools. Supports CSV files with columns: `Date`, `Log Name`, `Media Type`, `Duration`, `Language`.
- **Export** -- Export your logs to CSV with optional date range filtering.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **Rust** (latest stable, via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- **System dependencies** for Tauri on Linux:

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel

# Arch
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1 gtk3 libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg
```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Morgawr/kechimochi.git
cd kechimochi
npm install
```

### 2. Run in development mode

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

This will:
- Start the Vite dev server for hot-reloading the frontend
- Compile and launch the Rust backend
- Open the application window

### 3. Build a standalone binary

```bash
# On Arch Linux (or if AppImage build fails with strip errors)
NO_STRIP=true npx tauri build

# On Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora
npx tauri build
```

The compiled binary and packages will be at:

```
src-tauri/target/release/kechimochi              # raw binary
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/         # .AppImage (portable)
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/              # .deb (Debian/Ubuntu)
```

You can run the AppImage directly:

```bash
chmod +x src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/kechimochi_*.AppImage
./src-tauri/target/release/bundle/appimage/kechimochi_*.AppImage
```

Or just run the raw binary:

```bash
./src-tauri/target/release/kechimochi
```

> [!NOTE]
> On Arch Linux, `linuxdeploy`'s bundled `strip` tool is incompatible with Arch's newer ELF
> format. Setting `NO_STRIP=true` skips the stripping step and resolves the issue. The resulting
> AppImage will be slightly larger but functionally identical.

## CSV Format

For importing data, use the following CSV format:

```csv
Date,Log Name,Media Type,Duration,Language
2024-01-15,ある魔女が死ぬまで,Reading,45,Japanese
2024-01-15,Final Fantasy 7,Playing,120,Japanese
2024-01-16,呪術廻戦,Watching,25,Japanese
```

| Column       | Description                                          |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Date`      | `YYYY-MM-DD` format                                 |
| `Log Name`  | Title of the media                                   |
| `Media Type`| One of: `Reading`, `Watching`, `Playing`, `Listening`, `None` |
| `Duration`  | Duration in minutes (integer)                        |
| `Language`  | Language tag (e.g., `Japanese`, `Korean`)             |

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in SQLite databases in your system's application data directory:

- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/com.morg.kechimochi/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.morg.kechimochi/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\com.morg.kechimochi\`

Each profile has its own database file named `kechimochi_<profilename>.db`.
