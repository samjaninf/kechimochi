# Changelog

All notable changes to Kechimochi will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, with one section per released version.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
 - Added a Notes field to activity log entries (editable in the log modal, shown on the media detail page, included in sync and CSV export).
### Fixed
 - The tracking heatmap now colors days that have characters logged but no time tracked, in addition to days with time tracked. Cell intensity reflects whichever of the two is higher, so days tracked with both time and characters are not artificially brighter.
 - Milestones on the same media and same date now appear in creation order (oldest at the bottom, newest at the top) instead of alphabetically by name.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-06-10

### Added
 - Ability to use go back gesture or button on android to quit a popup or a media.
 - Shortcut button to medias from quick log
 - DMM games metadata importer (works on Fanza games too)
 - AniList manga metadata importer
 - Total hours count in study stats
 - Totals panel that shows a total of time spend / characters read for weeks, months, years and allows comparison with direct previous total.
 - Categories panel that shows a total for each media type.
 - Highlights panel that shows specific values : media with most time, sessions, chars, biggest streak, and day with the most time. All three panels use the timeframe selected in Activity Visualisation.
 - Can change which day is the begining of the week in settings for "weekly" view of activity visualisation and Totals.
 - Added "all time" selector in activity visualisation.

### Changed
 - Pop ups no longer appear behind the keyboard and center themselves in the visible space.
 - Reworked elements on the media page for compactness and aesthetics including : Estimation values, buttons above description and copy title button.
 - Adjusted a few colors in themes : Purple, Yellow lime, Deep blue, to have more readable buttons.
 - Made quick log display 6 elements on desktop and large mobiles.
 - Made loading of Medias faster when clicking from library and quick log shortcuts.
 - Monthly activity visualisation now labels bars with their date range (e.g. "Jun 1–7") instead of generic "Week 1 / Week 2".
 - Weekly activity visualisation now labels days with month names (e.g. "Jun 08") instead of numeric month-day labels.

### Fixed

 - Patch notes should now show long bullet lists with the right indentation
 - Changing media using the pagination now properly loads the logs.
 - The activity visualisation "next period" navigation button is now clearly greyed out when already viewing the current period, instead of appearing active but doing nothing.
 - Monthly activity visualisation no longer drops activity from the final partial week in some months.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-05-09

### Added
 - Desktop version now allows enabling an HTTP server backend for automation

### Fixed
 - Activities logged in weeks between month boundaries will now show the correct
   amount in the pie chart slice

### Special notes:

With the inclusion of an HTTP server option in the desktop build, users are now
able to automate certain activities (like logging entries, adding media, etc)
according to the backend API. This API is described in the http-api.md doc in
the github repository, refer to that if you want to know more.

Be aware that the HTTP server is unprotected and you are responsible for your
own local security as the app itself will not care about rejecting unauthorized
accesses.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-25
